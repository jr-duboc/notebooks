    "# Basic concepts and Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "A **set** is a group of things. *Things*, in this context, can really be anything we want: numbers, formulae, people, cows, etc.   \n",
    "They are denoted using curly braces, eg. $s = \\{1,4,56\\}$ is a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **subset** is a group of elements taken out of a set, eg. $e = \\{1,4\\}$ is a subset of $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets can be combined in various ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **union** of sets $A$ and $B$ contains all elements contained in $A$ or $B$, or in $A$ *and* $B$. It's written ${A}\\cup{B}$\n",
    "- An **intersection** of sets $A$ and $B$ contains only elements contained both in $A$ *and* $B$. It's written ${A}\\cap{B}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subset and supersets\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **subset** of a set $A$ is a list of elements taken from $A$ to form another set - written $B \\subseteq  A$ ($B$ *subset of* $A$)\n",
    "    - technically, A is a subset of itself. A **proper subset** of $A$ is a subset that isn't equal to $A$ - written $B \\subset  A$\n",
    "- A **superset** if $A$ contains all elements of $A$, plus (optionnaly) more elements (ex $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ is a superset of $\\{1,2,3\\}$). It's written $B \\supseteq  A$ ($B$ *superset of* $A$)\n",
    "    - again a **proper superset** of $A$ isn't equal to $A$. It's written $B \\supset  A$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notice that those notations are reversible, because a superset is the opposite of a subset and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **complement** of a set contains everything that's *not* in the set, and is written $\\complement{A}$ or $A^c$ "

    "# Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "A **permutation** is all the possible ways we can arrange the elements of a set. The number of permutations in a set of size $x$ is calculated using $x!$ (factorial of $x$). We have $x! = x + (x-1) + (x-2) + ... + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of permutations of subsets of size $k$ drawn from a set of size $n$ is\n",
    "noted $nPk$, and calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$nPk = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips \n",
    "\n",
    "- If $k > n$, then the reasoning is \"reversed\" but the number of permutations stays the same, so you just do $\\frac{k!}{(k-n)!}$\n",
    "- For decimal and complex numbers, use the **gamma function**: $\\Gamma \\left( x \\right) = \\int\\limits_0^\\infty {s^{x - 1} e^{ - s} ds}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Combinations** are the same as permutations, with one significant difference: the order of elements don't matter. Therefore a set only ever has one combination of itself. We can take a number of combinations out of a set though, by selecting subsets from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of combinations of subsets of size $k$ drawn from a set of size $n$ is noted $nCk$ or $n\\choose k$ and calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$nCk = \\frac{nPk}{k!}= \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always smaller than $nPk$. It's also called the [Binomial coefficient](../Maths%20and%20Computer%20Science/Stats/1.%20Probability.ipynb#Binomial-Distribution)."
